# Portfolio — [parsTroy]

A Next.js + TypeScript portfolio website showcasing my work, skills, and projects.

## Overview

This repository houses my personal portfolio website. It's meant to serve as:

- A hub to highlight my skills, experience, and projects
- A place where visitors can see live demos, read about my background, and contact me
- A demonstration of my front-end / full-stack development abilities

It is not intended as an open-source product or library; it's a personal site rather than a reusable package.

## Tech Stack & Key Features

Here's a summary of the tools and techniques used:

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Next.js (v14+) with app directory / routing | Framework & routing |
| TypeScript | Type safety and developer tooling |
| Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling |
| ESLint + linting config | Code consistency and error prevention |
| PostCSS | CSS transformations |
| Optional asset optimization / image handling | For performance and best practices |
